					<h1>Welcome to Educatalysts!</h1>
					<p>The coronavirus pandemic, which has been going on for 2 years, has completely changed the way of live. Almost all spheres of our lives have been altered, but fortunately, one sphere has suffered the least of all. And that is education.</p>
					<p>Since Education is a key element for humanity, we can be grateful because we live in a digital age that allows us distance learning.
					The widespread use of high-speed internet has made education more accessible than ever after.</p>	
					<p>So, our idea is to make educatalysts a platform for sharing and accessing notes,sample papers and watch videos all in one place. This platform has been designed for every learner wishing to share, learn and expand their knowledge. It contains well written notes, well explained videos and practice questions for their better result. </p>
